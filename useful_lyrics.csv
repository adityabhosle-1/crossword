1,You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors,1
1,It's the mornin' of your very first day,2
1,You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while,3
1,Try and stay out of everybody's way,4
1,It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here,5
1,For the next four years in this town,6
1,Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,7
1,"""You know, I haven't seen you around before""",8
1,'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you,9
1,You're gonna believe them,10
1,"And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out",11
1,"Well, count to ten, take it in",12
1,This is life before you know who you're gonna be,13
1,At fifteen,14
1,You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail,15
1,"And soon enough, you're best friends",16
1,Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool,17
1,We'll be outta here as soon as we can,18
1,And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car,19
1,And you're feelin' like flyin',20
1,And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one,21
1,And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends,22
1,When the night ends,23
1,'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you,24
1,You're gonna believe them,25
1,And when you're fifteen and your first kiss,26
1,"Makes your head spin around, well",27
1,In your life you'll do things greater than,28
1,Datin' the boy on the football team,29
1,I didn't know it at fifteen,30
1,When all you wanted was to be wanted,31
1,Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now,32
1,"Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday",33
1,But I realized some bigger dreams of mine,34
1,And Abigail gave everything she had,35
1,To a boy who changed his mind,36
1,And we both cried,37
1,Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you,38
1,You're gonna believe them,39
1,"And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall",40
1,But I've found time can heal most anything,41
1,And you just might find who you're supposed to be,42
1,I didn't know who I was supposed to be,43
1,At fifteen,44
1,"La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la",45
1,"La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la",46
1,"La-la-la, la-la-la",47
1,Your very first day,48
1,"Take a deep breath, girl",49
1,Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors,50
2,We were both young when I first saw you,1
2,I close my eyes and the flashback starts,2
2,I'm standing there,3
2,On a balcony in summer air,4
2,"See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns",5
2,See you make your way through the crowd,6
2,"And say, ""Hello""",7
2,Little did I know,8
2,"That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles",9
2,"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""",10
2,And I was crying on the staircase,11
2,"Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said",12
2,"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone",13
2,"I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run",14
2,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,15
2,"It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""",16
2,So I sneak out to the garden to see you,17
2,We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew,18
2,So close your eyes,19
2,"Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh",20
2,"'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter",21
2,"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""",22
2,But you were everything to me,23
2,"I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said",24
2,"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone",25
2,"I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run",26
2,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,27
2,"It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""",28
2,"Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel",29
2,"This love is difficult, but it's real",30
2,"Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess",31
2,"It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""",32
2,"Oh, oh",33
2,And I got tired of waiting,34
2,Wondering if you were ever coming around,35
2,My faith in you was fading,36
2,When I met you on the outskirts of town,37
2,"And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone",38
2,"I keep waiting for you, but you never come",39
2,"Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""",40
2,"He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said",41
2,"""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone",42
2,I love you and that's all I really know,43
2,"I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress",44
2,"It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""",45
2,"Oh, oh, oh",46
2,"Oh, oh, oh",47
2,'Cause we were both young when I first saw you,48
3,"Mmm-mm, mm-mm",1
3,"Mmm-mm, mm-mm",2
3,"Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah",3
3,"Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving",4
3,But I know I saw a light in you,5
3,And as we walked we were talking,6
3,I didn't say half the things I wanted to,7
3,Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window,8
3,I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold,9
3,"Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing",10
3,I don't always have to be alone,11
3,'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel,12
3,Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so,13
3,Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you,14
3,Can't help it if there's no one else,15
3,"Mmm, I can't help myself",16
3,"Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling",17
3,So I got some things to say to you,18
3,"I've seen it all, so I thought",19
3,But I never seen nobody shine the way you do,20
3,"The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name",21
3,"It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change",22
3,"Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?",23
3,I think you and I should stay the same,24
3,'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel,25
3,Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so,26
3,Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you,27
3,Can't help it if there's no one else,28
3,"Mmm, I can't help myself",29
3,"They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me",30
3,Why aren't you here tonight?,31
3,"I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out",32
3,"And pull me near and shine, shine, shine",33
3,"Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons",34
3,Why I should be the one you choose,35
3,"All those other girls, well, they're beautiful",36
3,But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha-ha),37
3,I can't help it if you look like an angel,38
3,Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so,39
3,Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you,40
3,Can't help it if there's no one else,41
3,"Mmm, I can't help myself",42
3,If you look like an angel,43
3,Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so,44
3,Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you,45
3,Can't help it if there's no one else,46
3,"Mmm, I can't help myself",47
3,"Ah-uh, myself",48
3,"Mmm-mm, I can't help myself",49
3,I can't help myself,50
3,Oh-oh-oh,51
3,"Mmm-mm, mm-mm",52
3,"Mmm-mm, mm-mm",53
3,"Mmm-mm, mm-mm",54
4,"Say you're sorry, that face of an angel",1
4,Comes out just when you need it to,2
4,As I paced back and forth all this time,3
4,'Cause I honestly believed in you,4
4,"Holdin' on, the days drag on",5
4,"Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known",6
4,"That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale",7
4,"I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell",8
4,"This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town",9
4,I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,10
4,Now it's too late for you and your white horse,11
4,To come around,12
4,"Maybe I was naïve, got lost in your eyes",13
4,And never really had a chance,14
4,"My mistake, I didn't know to bе in love",15
4,You had to fight to have the uppеr hand,16
4,I had so many dreams about you and me,17
4,"Happy endings, now I know",18
4,"That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale",19
4,"I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell",20
4,"This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town",21
4,I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,22
4,Now it's too late for you and your white horse,23
4,To come around,24
4,And there you are on your knees,25
4,"Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me",26
4,Just like I always wanted,27
4,But I'm so sorry,28
4,"'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale",29
4,I'm gonna find someone someday,30
4,Who might actually treat me well,31
4,"This is a big world, that was a small town",32
4,There in my rearview mirror disappearing now,33
4,And it's too late for you and your white horse,34
4,Now it's too late for you and your white horse,35
4,To catch me now,36
4,"Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa",37
4,"Try and catch me now, oh",38
4,It's too late to catch me now,39
5,"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset",1
5,She's going off about something that you said,2
5,'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do,3
5,"I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night",4
5,I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like,5
5,And she'll never know your story like I do,6
5,"Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts",7
5,She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers,8
5,Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find,9
5,That what you're looking for has been here the whole time,10
5,If you could see that I'm the onе who understands you,11
5,"Been here all along, so why can't you see?",12
5,"You bеlong with me, you belong with me",13
5,Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans,14
5,I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be,15
5,"Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself",16
5,"Hey, isn't this easy?",17
5,And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town,18
5,I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down,19
5,"You say you're fine, I know you better than that",20
5,"Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?",21
5,"She wears high heels, I wear sneakers",22
5,She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers,23
5,Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find,24
5,That what you're looking for has been here the whole time,25
5,If you could see that I'm the one who understands you,26
5,"Been here all along, so why can't you see?",27
5,You belong with me,28
5,Standing by and waiting at your back door,29
5,"All this time how could you not know, baby?",30
5,"You belong with me, you belong with me",31
5,"Oh, I remember you driving to my house",32
5,In the middle of the night,33
5,I'm the one who makes you laugh,34
5,When you know you're 'bout to cry,35
5,I know your favorite songs,36
5,And you tell me 'bout your dreams,37
5,Think I know where you belong,38
5,Think I know it's with me,39
5,Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you,40
5,"Been here all along, so why can't you see?",41
5,You belong with me,42
5,Standing by and waiting at your back door,43
5,"All this time how could you not know, baby?",44
5,"You belong with me, you belong with me",45
5,You belong with me,46
5,Have you ever thought just maybe,47
5,You belong with me?,48
5,You belong with me,49
6,I see your face in my mind as I drive away,1
6,'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way,2
6,People are people and sometimes we change our minds,3
6,But it's killing me to see you go after all this time,4
6,"Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm",5
6,"Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm",6
6,The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie,7
6,It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see,8
6,'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,9
6,Now I don't know what to be without you around,10

6,"Never a clean break, no one here to save me",12
6,You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,13
6,"And I can't breathe without you, but I have to",14
6,"Breathe without you, but I have to",15
6,"Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt",16
6,"Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve",17
6,But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out,18
6,And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout,19
6,"And we know it's never simple, never easy",20

6,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Ooh, ooh)",37
6,I'm sorry,38
7,"I took a chance, I took a shot",1
7,"And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not",2
7,"You took a swing, I took it hard",3
7,"And down here from the ground, I see who you are",4
7,I'm sick and tired of your attitude,5
7,I'm feeling like I don't know you,6
7,"You tell me that you love me, then cut me down",7
7,And I need you like a heartbeat,8
7,But you know you got a mean streak,9

7,"Well, you could write a book on",15
7,How to ruin someone's perfеct day,16
7,"Well, I get so confused and frustratеd",17
7,"Forget what I'm tryin' to say, oh",18
7,I'm sick and tired of your reasons,19
7,I got no one to believe in,20
7,"You tell me that you want me, then push me around",21
7,And I need you like a heartbeat,22
7,But you know you got a mean streak,23
7,Makes me run for cover when you're around,24

7,"Yes, I remember what you said last night",26
7,And I know that you see what you're doin' to me,27

7,So you can feel whole inside?,30
7,Why do you have to put down my dreams,31
7,So you're the only thing on my mind?,32
7,I'm sick and tired of your attitude,33

7,And I know that you see what you're doin' to me,41
7,Tell me why (Why),42
7,Tell me why (Oh),43
7,"I take a step back, I let you go",44
7,I told you I'm not bulletproof,45
7,Now you know,46
8,All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around,1
8,I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down,2
8,"And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out",3
8,"And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around",4
8,You don't have to call anymore,5
8,I won't pick up the phone,6
8,This is the last straw,7
8,Don't wanna hurt anymore,8

8,"No, no, oh-oh",12
8,"You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know",13
8,Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't lеft me waiting in the cold,14
8,And you've got your sharе of secrets,15
8,"And I'm tired of being last to know, oh",16
8,And now you're asking me to listen,17
8,'Cause it's worked each time before,18
8,But you don't have to call anymore,19

9,And that's the way I loved you,11

10,I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye,2
10,And we caught onto something,3
10,I hold onto the night,4
10,You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me,5
10,Were you just kidding?,6
10,'Cause it seems to me,7
10,"This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak",8
10,I don't feel welcome anymore,9
10,"Baby, what happened? Please tell me",10
10,'Cause one second it was perfect,11
10,Now you're halfway out the door,12
10,"And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called",13
10,And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all,14
10,"And you flashback to when he said, ""forever and always""",15
10,"Oh, and it rains in your bedroom",16
10,Everything is wrong,17
10,It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone,18
10,"'Cause I was there when you said, ""forever and always""",19
10,Was I out of line?,20
10,"Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide",21
10,Like a scared little boy?,22
10,I looked into your eyes,23
10,"Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure",24
10,So here's to everything coming down to nothing,25
10,Here's to silence that cuts me to the core,26
10,Where is this going?,27
10,"Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore",28
10,"And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called",29
10,And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all,30
10,"And you flashback to when he said, ""forever and always""",31
10,"Oh, and it rains in your bedroom",32
10,Everything is wrong,33
10,It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone,34
10,"'Cause I was there when you said, ""forever and always""",35
10,"You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so",36
10,"Oh, back up, baby, back up",37
10,Did you forget everything?,38
10,"Back up, baby, back up",39
10,Did you forget everything?,40
10,'Cause it rains in your bedroom,41
10,Everything is wrong,42
10,It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone,43

10,"'Cause I was there when you said, ""forever and always""",51
10,You didn't mean it baby,52
10,"You said, ""forever and always,"" yeah",53
11,"I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on",1
11,"I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run",2
11,Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides,3
11,"Look now, the sky is gold",4
11,I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home,5
11,I don't know why all the trees change in the fall,6
11,But I know you're not scared of anything at all,7
11,Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away,8
11,But I know I had the best day with you today,9
11,I'm thirteen now,10
11,And don't know how my friends could be so mean,11
11,I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys,12
11,And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away,13
11,And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names,14
11,I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school,15
11,But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you,16
11,Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay,17
11,But I know I had the best day with you today,18
11,"I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger",19
11,"God smiles on my little brother, inside and out",20
11,He's better than I am,21
11,I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run,22
11,And I had the best days with you,23
11,There is a video I found from back when I was three,24
11,You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me,25
11,It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves,26
11,Daddy's smart,27
11,And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world,28
11,Now I know why all the trees change in the fall,29
11,I know you were on my side even when I was wrong,30
11,And I love you for giving me your eyes,31
11,For staying back and watching me shine,32
11,"And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say",33
11,That I had the best day with you today,34
12,"Well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you",1
12,Somebody else gets what you wanted again and,2
12,"You know it’s all the same, another time and place",3
12,Repeating history and you're getting sick of it,4
12,But I believe in whatever you do,5
12,And I'll do anything to see it through,6
12,Because these things will change,7
12,Can you feel it now?,8
12,These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down,9
12,"This revolution, the time will come",10
12,For us to finally win,11
12,"And we’ll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah",12
12,"Oh, oh",13
12,"So we've been outnumbered, raidеd, and now cornered",14
12,It's hard to fight when thе fight ain't fair,15
12,"We're getting stronger now, find things they never found",16
12,They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared,17
12,"You can walk away, say we don't need this",18
12,But there’s something in your eyes says we can beat this,19
12,’Cause these things will change,20
12,Can you feel it now?,21
12,These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down,22
12,"This revolution, the time will come",23
12,For us to finally win,24
12,"And we'll sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah",25
12,"Oh, oh",26
12,"Tonight, we'll stand, get off our knees",27
12,Fight for what we've worked for all these years,28
12,"And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives",29
12,But we’ll stand up champions tonight,30
12,It was the night things changed,31
12,Can you see it now?,32
12,When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down,33
12,"It's a revolution, throw your hands up",34
12,'Cause we never gave in,35
12,"And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah",36
12,Hallelujah,37
13,I like the way you sound in the morning,1
13,We're on the phone and without a warning,2
13,I realize your laugh is the best sound,3
13,I have ever heard,4
13,I like the way I can't keep my focus,5
13,"I watch you talk, you didn't notice",6
13,I hear the words but all I can think is,7
13,We should be together,8
13,"Every time you smile, I smile",9
13,"And every time you shine, I'll shine for you",10
13,"Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby",11
13,Don't be afraid to,12
13,Jump then fall,13
13,Jump then fall into me,14
13,"Baby, I'm never gonna leave you",15
13,Say that you wanna be with me too,16
13,'Cause I'ma stay through it all,17
13,So jump then fall,18
13,"Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face",19
13,You got the keys to me,20
13,"I love each freckle on your face, oh",21
13,"I've never been so wrapped up, honey",22
13,I like the way you're everything I ever wanted,23
13,I had time to think it over,24
13,And all I can say is come closer,25
13,Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me,26
13,"Cause every time you smile, I smile",27
13,"And every time you shine, I'll shine for you",28
13,"Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby",29
13,Don't be afraid to,30
13,Jump then fall,31
13,Jump then fall into me,32
13,"Baby, I'm never gonna leave you",33
13,Say that you wanna be with me too,34
13,'Cause I'ma stay through it all,35
13,So jump then fall,36
13,The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet,37
13,"I'll catch you, I'll catch you",38
13,When people say things that bring you to your knees,39
13,I'll catch you,40
13,The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry,41
13,But I'll hold you through the night until you smile,42
13,"Whoa oh, I need you, baby",43
13,"Don't be afraid, please",44
13,Jump then fall,45

13,"Baby, I'll show you, I'll show you",56
13,"You can jump then fall, jump then fall",57
13,"Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah",58
14,Untouchable like a distant diamond sky,1
14,I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why,2
14,"I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you",3
14,"Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun",4
14,"And when you're close, I feel like coming undone",5
14,In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream,6
14,It's like a million little stars spelling out your name,7
14,"You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together",8
14,"Come on, come on, little taste of heaven",9
14,It's half full and I won't wait here all day,10

18,And the faded picture of a beautiful night,43
18,You carried me from your car up the stairs,44
18,"And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?",45
18,After everything and that little black dress,46
18,"After everything I must confess, I need you",47
19,Today was a fairytale,1

19,Today was a fairytale,56
19,"Oh, oh, yeah, oh-oh",57
19,Today was a fairytale,58
20,Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement,1
20,"Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do",2
20,The way the tires turn stones on old county roads,3
20,"They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you",4
20,You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls,5
20,"You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be",6
20,"But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in",7
20,"You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me",8
20,"I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned",9
20,"Held out, and held on",10
20,"God knows, too long, and wasted time",11
20,"Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here",12
20,But no amount of freedom gets you clean,13
20,I've still got you all over me,14
20,The best and worst day of June,15
20,Was the one that I met you,16
20,With your hands in your pockets,17
20,"And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin",18
20,"Well I did, so I smiled",19
20,And I melted like a child,20
20,Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then,21
20,"And I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned",22
20,"Held out, and held on",23
20,"God knows, too long, and wasted time",24
20,"Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here",25
20,But no amount of freedom gets you clean,26
20,I've still got you all over me,27
20,"I lived, and I learned",28
20,And found out what it was to turn around,29
20,And see that we,30
20,Were never really meant to be,31
20,"So I lied, and I cried",32
20,And I watched a part of myself die,33
20,'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean,34
20,I've still got you all over me,35
20,I've still got you all over me,36
20,Still got you all over me,37

22,We used to walk along the streets,1

22,Before I had somewhere to be,3
22,Back when we had all night and we were happy,4

25,This is the last time I'll drive this way again,4
25,Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray,5
25,"'Cause I, I still love you but I can't",6
25,Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side,7

25,Bye bye baby,45
26,I'm walking fast through the traffic lights,1
26,Busy streets and busy lives,2
26,And all we know is touch and go,3
26,We are alone with our changing minds,4
26,We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds,5
26,Or fades in time,6
26,And I never (Never),7
26,Saw you coming,8
26,And I’ll never (Never),9
26,Be the same,10
26,You come around and the armor falls,11
26,Pierce the room like a cannonball,12
26,Now all we know is don’t let go,13
26,"We are alone, just you and me",14
26,Up in your room and our slates are clean,15
26,"Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes",16
26,So you were never a saint,17
26,And I've loved in shades of wrong,18
26,We learn to live with the pain,19
26,Mosaic broken hearts,20
26,But this love is brave and wild,21
26,And I never (Never),22
26,Saw you coming,23
26,And I’ll never (Never),24
26,Be the same,25
26,This is a state of grace,26
26,This is the worthwhile fight,27
26,Love is a ruthless game,28
26,Unless you play it good and right,29
26,These are the hands of fate,30
26,You’re my Achilles heel,31
26,This is the golden age,32
26,Of something good and right and real,33
26,And I never (Never),34
26,Saw you coming,35

26,This is the worthwhile fight,46
26,Love is a ruthless game,47
26,Unless you play it good and right,48
27,Loving him is like,1
27,Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street,2
27,"Faster than the wind, passionate as sin",3
27,Ending so suddenly,4
27,Loving him is like trying to change your mind,5
27,Once you're already flying through the free fall,6
27,"Like the colors in autumn, so bright",7
27,Just before they lose it all,8
27,Losing him was blue like I'd never known,9
27,"Missing him was dark gray, all alone",10
27,Forgetting him was like,11
27,Trying to know somebody you never met,12
27,But loving him was red,13
27,"(Red, red)",14
27,"(Red, red)",15
27,Loving him was red,16
27,"(Red, red)",17
27,"(Red, red)",18
27,Touching him was like,19
27,Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you,20
27,Memorizing him was as,21
27,Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song,22
27,Fighting with him was like,23
27,Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer,24
27,Regretting him was like,25
27,Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong,26
27,Losing him was blue like I'd never known,27
27,"Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)",28
27,Forgetting him was like,29
27,Trying to know somebody you never met,30
27,But loving him was red,31
27,"(Red, red)",32
27,"Oh, red (Red, red)",33
27,"Burning red (Red, red)",34
27,"(Red, red)",35
27,Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes,36
27,"Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go",37
27,But moving on from him is impossible,38
27,When I still see it all in my head,39
27,In burning red,40
27,"Burning, it was red",41
27,"Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known",42
27,"Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)",43
27,Forgetting him was like,44
27,Trying to know somebody you never met,45
27,'Cause loving him was red,46
27,"(Red, red) Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)",47
27,"Burning red (Red, red)",48
27,"(Red, red)",49
27,"And that's why (Red, red) he's spinning 'round in my head",50
27,"Comes back to me (Red, red), burning red",51
27,"(Red, red) Yeah, yeah",52
27,"(Red, red)",53
27,His love was like,54
27,Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street,55
28,Put your lips close to mine,1
28,As long as they don't touch,2
28,"Out of focus, eye to eye",3
28,'Til the gravity's too much,4
28,And I'll do anything you say,5
28,If you say it with your hands,6
28,And I'd be smart to walk away,7
28,But you're quicksand,8
28,This slope is treacherous,9
28,This path is reckless,10
28,This slope is treacherous,11
28,And I-I-I like it,12
28,I can't decide if it's a choice,13
28,Getting swept away,14
28,I hear the sound of my own voice,15
28,Asking you to stay,16
28,And all we are is skin and bone,17
28,Trained to get along,18
28,Forever going with the flow,19
28,But you're friction,20
28,[Chorus],21
28,This slope is treacherous,22
28,This path is reckless,23
28,This slope is treacherous,24
28,"I, I, I like it",25
28,Two headlights shine through the sleepless night,26
28,"And I will get you, get you alone",27
28,Your name has echoed through my mind,28
28,"And I just think you should, think you should know",29
28,That nothing safe is worth the drive,30
28,"And I would follow you, follow you home",31
28,"I'll follow you, follow you home",32
28,This hope is treacherous,33
28,This daydream is dangerous,34
28,This hope is treacherous,35
28,"I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I",36
28,Two headlights shine through the sleepless night,37
28,"And I will get you, get you alone",38
28,Your name has echoed through my mind,39
28,"And I just think you should, think you should know",40
28,That nothing safe is worth the drive,41
28,"And I would follow you, follow you home",42
28,"I'll follow you, follow you home",43
28,"I'll follow you, follow you home",44
28,"I'll follow you, follow you home",45
28,This slope is treacherous,46
28,I-I-I like it,47
29,"Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago",1
29,"I was in your sights, you got me alone",2
29,"You found me, you found me, you found me",3
29,"I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that",4
29,"And when I fell hard, you took a step back",5
29,"Without me, without me, without me",6
29,And he's long gone when he's next to me,7
29,And I realize the blame is on me,8
29,'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in,9
29,So shame on me now,10
29,Flew me to places I'd never been,11

29,So shame on me now,14
29,Flew me to places I'd never been,15
29,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground,16
29,"Oh, oh-oh",17

29,"Oh, oh-oh",19
29,"Trouble, trouble, trouble",20
29,"No apologies, he'll never see you cry",21
29,Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why,22
29,"You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning",23
29,And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street,24
29,A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be,25
29,"And now I see, now I see, now I see",26
29,He was long gone when he met me,27
29,"And I realize the joke is on me, hey",28
29,I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh),29

29,"Oh, oh-oh (Yeah)",37
29,"Trouble, trouble, trouble",38
29,"Oh, oh-oh",39
29,"Trouble, trouble, trouble",40
29,And the saddest fear,41
29,Comes creeping in,42
29,That you never loved me,43
29,"Or her, or anyone, or anything",44
29,Yeah,45
29,I knew you were trouble when you walked in,46
29,So shame on me now,47

29,"Trouble, trouble, trouble",59
29,I knew you were trouble when you walked in,60
29,"Trouble, trouble, trouble",61
30,"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold",1
30,But something 'bout it felt like home somehow,2
30,And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,3
30,"And you've still got it in your drawer, even now",4
30,"Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze",5
30,"We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate",6
30,Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,7
30,And I can picture it after all these days,8
30,And I know it's long gone and,9
30,That magic's not here no more,10
30,"And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all",11
30,"Oh, oh, oh",12
30,'Cause there we are again on that little town street,13

30,"Wind in my hair, I was there",15
30,I remember it all too well,16
30,"Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red",17
30,You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed,18
30,And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team,19
30,"You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me",20
30,And I know it's long gone and,21
30,There was nothing else I could do,22
30,And I forget about you long enough,23
30,To forget why I needed to,24
30,'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night,25

30,'Til you tore it all up,32
30,"Running scared, I was there",33
30,I remember it all too well,34
30,And you call me up again,35
30,Just to break me like a promise,36
30,So casually cruel in the name of being honest,37
30,I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here,38
30,"'Cause I remember it all, all, all",39
30,Too well,40
30,"Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it",41
30,"I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it",42
30,After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own,43
30,Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone,44
30,But you keep my old scarf from that very first week,45
30,'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me,46
30,You can't get rid of it,47
30,"'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah",48
30,'Cause there we are again when I loved you so,49
30,Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known,50

72,When I walk in the room,47

76,"Once upon a time, the planets and the fates",1
76,And all the stars aligned,2
76,You and I ended up in the same room,3
76,At the same time,4
76,And the touch of a hand lit the fuse,5
76,Of a chain reaction of countermoves,6
76,To assess the equation of you,7
76,"Checkmate, I couldn't lose",8
76,What if I told you none of it was accidental?,9
76,And the first night that you saw me,10

76,Cause I'm a mastermind,18
76,"You see, all the wisеst women",19

76,In every lover's game,22
76,"If you fail to plan, you plan to fail",23
76,Strategy sets the scene for the tale,24
76,I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails,25

76,It was all my design,35
76,Cause I'm a mastermind,36
76,No one wanted to play with me as a little kid,37
76,So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since,38
76,To make them love me and make it seem effortless,39
76,This is the first time I've felt the need to confess,40
76,And I swear,41
76,I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian,42
76,Cause I care,43
76,So I told you none of it was accidental,44
76,And the first night that you saw me,45
76,Nothing was gonna stop me,46
76,"I laid the groundwork, and then",47
76,Saw a wide smirk on your face,48
76,You knew the entire time,49

77,"Uh-huh, tears on the lеtter",13
77,I vowed not to cry anymore,14
77,If wе survived the Great War,15
77,You drew up some good faith treaties,16
77,"I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone",17
77,You said I have to trust more freely,18
77,"But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire",19
77,And maybe it's the past that's talking,20
77,Screaming from a crypt,21
77,Telling me to punish you for things you never did,22
77,So I justified it,23
77,"All that bloodshed, crimson clover",24
77,"Uh-huh, the bombs were closer",25
77,My hand was the one you reached for,26
77,All throughout the Great War,27

77,Your finger on my hairpin triggers,35
77,"Soldier down on that icy ground, looked up at me with honor and truth",36
77,"Broken and blue, so I called off the troops",37
77,That was the night I nearly lost you,38
77,I really thought I'd lost you,39
77,We can plant a memory garden,40
77,"Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair",41
77,"There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair",42
77,And we will never go back,43
77,"To that bloodshed, crimson clover",44
77,"Uh-huh, the worst was over",45
77,My hand was the one you reached for,46
77,All throughout the Great War,47
77,Always remember,48
77,"Uh-huh, we're burned for better",49
77,I vowed I would always be yours,50
77,Cause we survived the Great War,51

78,No words appear before me in the aftermath,1
78,Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears,2
78,Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness,3
78,"Cause it's all over now, all out to sea",4
78,"Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye",5
78,You were bigger than the whole sky,6
78,You were more than just a short time,7
78,And I've got a lot to pine about,8
78,I've got a lot to live without,9
78,I'm never gonna meet,10
78,"What could've been, would've been",11
78,What should've been you,12
78,"What could've been, would've been you",13
78,Did some bird flap its wings ovеr in Asia?,14
78,Did some force take you bеcause I didn't pray?,15
78,Every single thing to come has turned into ashes,16
78,"Cause it's all over, it's not meant to be",17
78,So I'll say words I don't believe,18
78,"Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye",19
78,You were bigger than the whole sky,20
78,You were more than just a short time,21
78,And I've got a lot to pine about,22

79,Your ex-friend's sister,1
79,Met someone at a club and he kissed her,2
79,"Turns out, it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago",3
79,Some wannabe Z-lister,4

79,"No, I didn't, but thanks, though",8
79,I'm so in love that I might stop breathing,9

79,Cause we were somewhere else,12
79,Stumbled down pretend alleyways,13
79,"Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne",14
79,I was taken by the view,15
79,Like we were in Paris,16
79,Like we were somewhere else,17
79,"Like we were in Paris, oh",18
79,We were somewhere else,19
79,Privacy sign on the door,20
79,And on my page and on the whole world,21
79,Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours,22
79,Levitate above all the messes made,23
79,Sip quiet by my side in the shade,24
79,And not the kind that's thrown,25
79,"I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown",26
79,I'm so in love that I might stop breathing,27

79,To somewhere the culture's clever,41
79,Confess my truth,42
79,"In swooping, sloping, cursive letters",43
79,Let the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight,44
79,In my mind,45
79,We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling,46
79,"No, I didn't see the news",47
79,Cause we were somewhere else,48
79,"In an alleyway, drinking champagne",49

80,Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th?,15
80,Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?,16
80,"Storm coming, good husband",17
80,Bad omen,18
80,Dragged my feet right down the aisle,19
80,"At the house lonely, good money",20
80,I'd pay if you'd just know me,21
80,Seemed like the right thing at the time,22

82,"If you tasted poison, you could've",3
82,Spit me out at the first chance,4
82,"And if I was some paint, did it splatter",5
82,On a promising grown man?,6

82,"Ooh, all I used to do was pray",9
82,"Would've, could've, should've",10
82,If you'd never looked my way,11
82,I would've stayed on my knees,12
82,And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil,13
82,At nineteen,14
82,And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven,15
82,"And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts",16
82,Memories feel like weapons,17
82,"And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering",18

82,I could've gone on as I was,24
82,"But, Lord, you made me feel important",25
82,And then you tried to erase us,26
82,"Ooh, you're a crisis of my faith",27
82,"Would've, could've, should've",28
82,If I'd only played it safe,29

95,Only bought this dress so you could take it off,64
95,"Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah",65
95,There is an indentation in the shape of you,66
95,Only bought this dress so you could take it off,67
95,"You made your mark on me, golden tattoo",68

96,It was so nice throwing big parties,1
96,Jump into the pool from the balcony,2
96,Everyone swimming in a champagne sea,3
96,And there are no rules when you show up here,4
96,Bass beat rattling the chandelier,5
96,Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year,6
96,So why'd you have to rain on my parade?,7
96,I'm shaking my head and locking the gates,8
96,"This is why we can't have nice things, darling",9
96,Because you break them,10
96,I had to take them away,11
96,"This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)",12
96,Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?,13
96,This is why we can't have nice things,14
96,It was so nice being friends again,15
96,"There I was, giving you a second chance",16
96,But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand,17
96,And therein lies the issue,18
96,Friends don't try to trick you,19
96,Get you on the phone and mind-twist you,20
96,And so I took an axe to a mended fence,21
96,But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm),22
96,If only you weren't so shady,23
96,"This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)",24
96,Because you break them,25
96,I had to take them away,26
96,"This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey",27
96,Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?,28
96,This is why we can't have,29
96,Here's a toast to my real friends,30
96,"They don't care about the he-said, she-said",31
96,And here's to my baby,32
96,He ain't reading what they call me lately,33
96,And here's to my mama,34
96,Had to listen to all this drama,35
96,And here's to you,36
96,'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do,37
96,"Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face",38
96,"This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)",39
96,Because you break them,40
96,I had to take them away,41
96,"This is why we can't have nice (Uh-uh) things (Oh no), honey (Baby, oh)",42
96,Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?,43
96,"This is why we can't have nice things, darling",44
96,(And here's to my real friends),45
96,Because you break them,46
96,I had to take them,47
96,(And here's to my baby),48
96,"Nice things, honey",49
96,"(They didn't care about that he-said, she-said)",50
96,Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?,51
96,This is why we can't have nice things,52

97,Windows boarded up after the storm,19
97,He built a fire just to keep me warm,20
97,All the drama queens taking swings,21
97,All the jokers dressing up as kings,22
97,They fade to nothing when I look at him,23
97,And I know I make the same mistakes every time,24
97,"Bridges burn, I never learn",25
97,At least I did one thing right,26
97,I did one thing right,27

99,Put those Georgia stars to shame that night,2
99,"I said, ""That's a lie""",3
99,Just a boy in a Chevy truck,4
99,That had a tendency of gettin' stuck,5
99,On back roads at night,6
99,And I was right there beside him all summer long,7
99,And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone,8
99,But when you think Tim McGraw,9
99,I hope you think my favorite song,10
99,The one we danced to all night long,11
99,The moon like a spotlight on the lake,12
99,When you think happiness,13
99,I hope you think that little black dress,14

101,I fake a smile so he won't see,2
101,That I want and I'm needing,3
101,Everything that we should be,4
101,"I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about",5

101,That I can't even see,9
101,Anyone when he's with me,10
101,"He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right",11
101,I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night,12
101,He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar,13
101,The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star,14
101,He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do,15
101,Drew walks by me,16
101,Can he tell that I can't breathe?,17
101,"And there he goes, so perfectly",18
101,The kind of flawless I wish I could be,19
101,"She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love",20
101,Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause,21
101,He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar,22
101,The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star,23
101,He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do,24
101,"So, I drive home alone",25
101,As I turn out the light,26
101,I'll put his picture down,27
101,And maybe get some sleep tonight,28
101,'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar,29
101,The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart,30
101,He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do,31
101,"He's the time taken up, but there's never enough",32
101,And he's all that I need to fall into,33
101,Drew looks at me,34
101,I fake a smile so he won't see,35
102,"I don't know what I want, so don't ask me",1
102,'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out,2
102,"Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking",3
102,Trying to see through the rain coming down,4

103,You have a way of coming easily to me,1
103,"And when you take, you take the very best of me",2
103,So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something,3
103,And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted,4
103,"Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day",5
103,"Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say",6
103,And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,7
103,I've never been anywhere cold as you,8
103,You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray,9
103,And I stood there loving you and wished them all away,10
103,And you come away with a great little story,11
103,Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you,12
103,"Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day",13
103,"So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say",14
103,And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,15
103,I've never been anywhere cold as you,16
103,"You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you",17
103,"And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you, died for you",18
103,"Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day",19
103,Every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made,20
103,And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,21
103,I've never been anywhere cold as you,22
104,I didn't know what I would find,1
104,When I went looking for a reason,2
104,I know I didn't read between the lines,3
104,"And, baby, I've got nowhere to go",4
104,I tried to take the road less traveled by,5
104,But nothing seems to work the first few times,6
104,Am I right?,7
104,So how can I ever try to be better?,8
104,Nobody ever lets me in,9
104,I can still see you,10
104,This ain't the best view,11
104,On the outside looking in,12
104,And I've been a lot of lonely places,13
104,I've never been on the outside,14
104,"You saw me there, but never knew",15
104,That I would give it all up to be,16
104,"A part of this, a part of you",17
104,And now it's all too late. So you see,18
104,You could've helped if you had wanted to,19

104,I've never been on the outside,35
105,Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty,1
105,Is the face in the mirror looking back at you,2
105,You walk around here thinking you're not pretty,3

107,"You should've said ""No"", baby, and you might still have me",15
107,You can see that I've been crying,16
107,"And baby, you know all the right things to say",17
107,But do you honestly expect me to believe,18
107,We could ever be the same?,19

108,"Oh my, my, my, my",13
108,"Well, I was sixteen when suddenly",14
108,I wasn't that little girl you used to see,15
108,But your eyes still shined like pretty lights,16
108,And our daddies used to joke about the two of us,17

108,And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes,19
108,"And said, ""Oh my, my, my""",20
108,Take me back to the creek beds we turned up,21
108,"Two A.M. riding in your truck, and all I need is you next to me",22
108,Take me back to the time we had our very first fight,23
108,The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight,24
108,You stayed outside 'til the morning light,25
108,"Oh my, my, my, my",26
108,A few years had gone and come around,27
108,We were sitting at our favorite spot in town,28
108,"And you looked at me, got down on one knee",29
108,Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle,30
108,Our whole town came and our mamas cried,31
108,"You said ""I do"" and I did too",32
108,Take me home where we met so many years before,33
108,We'll rock our babies on that very front porch,34
108,"After all this time, you and I",35
108,I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine,36
108,I'll still look at you like the stars that shine,37
108,"In the sky, oh my, my, my",38
109,I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone,1
109,In the front seat of his car,2
109,He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel,3
109,The other on my heart,4
109,"I look around, turn the radio down",5
109,"He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""",6
109,"I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'",7
109,"How we don't have a song""",8
109,And he says,9
109,Our song is the slamming screen door,10
109,"Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window",11
109,When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,12
109,'Cause it's late and your mama don't know,13

109,"The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""",15
109,And when I got home 'fore I said amen,16
109,Asking God if he could play it again,17
109,I was walking up the front porch steps,18
109,After everything that day,19
109,Had gone all wrong or been trampled on,20
109,And lost and thrown away,21
109,"Got to the hallway, well on my way",22
109,To my lovin' bed,23
109,I almost didn't notice all the roses,24
109,And the note that said,25
109,Our song is the slamming screen door,26
109,"Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window",27
109,When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,28
109,'Cause it's late and your mama don't know,29

109,Asking God if he could play it again,33
109,Da-da-da-da,34
109,"I've heard every album, listened to the radio",35
109,Waited for somethin' to come along,36
109,That was as good as our song,37
109,'Cause our song is the slamming screen door,38
109,"Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window",39
109,When we're on the phone and he talks real slow,40

109,"Oh, oh, yeah",47
109,I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone,48
109,In the front seat of his car,49
109,I grabbed a pen and an old napkin,50
109,And I wrote down our song,51
110,Friday night beneath the stars,1
110,In a field behind your yard,2
110,You and I are painting pictures in the sky,3
110,And sometimes we don't say a thing,4
110,Just listen to the crickets sing,5
110,Everything I need is right here by my side,6
110,And I know everything about you,7
110,I don't wanna live without you,8
110,I'm only up when you're not down,9
110,Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground,10
110,It's like no matter what I do,11
110,"Well, you drive me crazy half the time",12
110,"The other half, I'm only tryna",13
110,Let you know that what I feel is true,14
110,And I'm only me when I'm with you,15
110,Just a small-town boy and girl,16
110,Living in a crazy world,17
110,Tryna figure out what is and isn't true,18
110,And I don't try to hide my tears,19
110,My secrets or my deepest fears,20
110,Through it all nobody gets me like you do,21
110,And you know everything about me,22
110,You say that you can't live without me,23
110,I'm only up when you're not down,24
110,Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground,25
110,It's like no matter what I do,26
110,"Well, you drive me crazy half the time",27

110,Let you know that what I feel is true,29
110,And I'm only me when I'm with you,30
110,When I'm with anybody else,31
110,It's so hard to be myself,32
110,And only you can tell,33
110,That I'm only up when you're not down,34
110,Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground,35
110,It's like no matter what I do,36

111,No matter what you do,20
111,And all I think about is how to make you think of me,21
111,And everything that we could be,22
111,I just wanna show you,23

111,And make you realize,35

113,He says he's so in love,13
113,He's finally got it right,14
113,I wonder if he knows,15
113,He's all I think about at night,16
113,He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar,17
113,The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star,18
113,He's the song in the car I keep singing,19
113,Don't know why I do,20

113,Can he tell that I can't breathe?,22
113,"And there he goes, so perfectly",23

113,Give him all her love,26
113,Look in those beautiful eyes,27
113,And know she's lucky 'cause,28

113,He's the song in the car I keep singing,31
113,Don't know why I do,32
113,So I drive home alone,33
113,As I turn out the light,34
113,I'll put his picture down,35
113,And maybe get some sleep tonight,36
113,'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar,37

176,"Today is never too late to be brand new, oh",36
176,"It's alright, just wait and see",37
176,Your string of lights is still bright to me,38
176,"Oh, who you are is not where you've been",39
176,You're still an innocent,40
176,"It's okay, life is a tough crowd",41
176,32 and still growing up now,42
176,Who you are is not what you did,43
176,"You're still an innocent, you're still an innocent",44
176,"Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh",45
176,It's never too late to get it back,46
177,You and I walk a fragile line,1
177,I have known it all this time,2
177,But I never thought I'd live to see it break,3
177,It's getting dark and it's all too quiet,4
177,And I can't trust anything now,5
177,And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake,6
177,"Whoa, holding my breath",7
177,Won't lose you again,8
177,Something's made your eyes go cold,9
177,"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this",10
177,I thought I had you figured out,11
177,Something's gone terribly wrong,12
177,You're all I wanted,13
177,"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this",14
177,I thought I had you figured out,15
177,Can't breathe whenever you're gone,16
177,"Can't turn back now, I'm haunted",17
177,Stood there and watched you walk away,18
177,From everything we had,19
177,But I still mean every word I said to you,20
177,He will try to take away my pain,21
177,And he just might make me smile,22
177,"But the whole time, I'm wishing it was you instead",23
177,"Oh, holding my breath",24
177,Won't see you again,25
177,Something keeps me holding onto nothing,26
177,"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this",27
177,I thought I had you figured out,28
177,Something's gone terribly wrong,29
177,You're all I wanted,30
177,"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this",31
177,I thought I had you figured out,32
177,Can't breathe whenever you're gone,33
177,"Can't turn back now, I'm haunted",34
177,I know,35
177,I know,36
177,I just know,37
177,"You're not gone, you can't be gone, no",38
177,"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this",39
177,I thought I had you figured out,40
177,Something's gone terribly wrong,41
177,Won't finish what you started,42
177,"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this",43
177,I thought I had you figured out,44
177,Can't breathe whenever you're gone,45
177,"Can't go back, I'm haunted",46
177,"(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)",47
177,You and I walk a fragile line,48
177,I have known it all this time,49
177,Never ever thought I'd see it break,50
177,Never thought I'd see it,51
178,I still remember the look on your face,1
178,Lit through the darkness at 1:58,2
178,The words that you whispered,3
178,For just us to know,4
178,You told me you loved me,5
178,So why did you go away?,6
178,Away,7
178,I do recall now the smell of the rain,8
178,Fresh on the pavement,9
178,I ran off the plane,10
178,That July 9th,11
178,The beat of your heart,12
178,It jumps through your shirt,13
178,I can still feel your arms,14
178,But now I'll go sit on the floor,15
178,Wearing your clothes,16
178,All that I know is,17
178,I don't know how to be something you miss,18
178,I never thought we'd have a last kiss,19
178,Never imagined we'd end like this,20
178,"Your name, forever the name on my lips",21
178,I do remember the swing of your step,22
178,"The life of the party, you're showing off again",23
178,And I roll my eyes and then,24
178,You pull me in,25
178,I'm not much for dancing,26
178,But for you I did,27
178,"Because I love your handshake, meeting my father",28
178,I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets,29
178,How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something,30
178,There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions,31
178,And I'll go sit on the floor,32
178,Wearing your clothes,33
178,All that I know is,34
178,I don't know how to be something you miss,35
178,I never thought we'd have a last kiss,36
178,I never imagined we'd end like this,37
178,"Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh",38
178,So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep,39
178,And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe,40
178,And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are,41
178,Hope it's nice where you are,42
178,And I hope the sun shines,43
178,And it's a beautiful day,44
178,And something reminds you,45
178,You wish you had stayed,46
178,You can plan for a change in weather and time,47
178,But I never planned on you changing your mind,48
178,So I'll go sit on the floor,49
178,Wearing your clothes,50
178,All that I know is,51
178,I don't know how to be something you miss,52
178,I never thought we'd have a last kiss,53
178,Never imagined we'd end like this,54
178,"Your name, forever the name on my lips",55
178,Just like our last kiss,56
178,Forever the name on my lips,57
178,Forever the name on my lips,58
178,Just like our last,59
179,"I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind",1
179,The time we stood with our shaking hands,2
179,The crowds in stands went wild,3
179,We were the kings and the queens,4
179,And they read off our names,5
179,The night you danced like you knew our lives,6
179,Would never be the same,7
179,You held your head like a hero,8
179,On a history book page,9
179,It was the end of a decade,10
179,But the start of an age,11
179,Long live the walls we crashed through,12
179,All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you,13
179,"I was screaming, long live all the magic we made",14
179,And bring on all the pretenders,15
179,"One day, we will be remembered",16
179,"I said, remember this feeling",17
179,I passed the pictures around,18
179,Of all the years that we stood there,19
179,On the side-lines wishing for right now,20
179,We are the kings and the queens,21
179,You traded your baseball cap for a crown,22
179,When they gave us our trophies,23
179,And we held them up for our town,24
179,And the cynics were outraged,25
179,"Screaming, ""This is absurd""",26
179,"'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves",27
179,In ripped up jeans got to rule the world,28
179,Long live the walls we crashed through,29
179,All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you,30
179,"I was screaming, long live all the magic we made",31
179,And bring on all the pretenders,32
179,I'm not afraid,33
179,Long live all the mountains we moved,34
179,I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you,35
179,"I was screaming, long live that look on your face",36
179,And bring on all the pretenders,37
179,"One day, we will be remembered",38
179,Hold on to spinning around,39
179,Confetti falls to the ground,40
179,May these memories break our fall,41
179,Will you take a moment?,42
179,Promise me this,43
179,That you'll stand by me forever,44
179,"But if, God forbid, fate should step in",45
179,And force us into a goodbye,46
179,If you have children some day,47
179,When they point to the pictures,48
179,Please tell them my name,49
179,Tell them how the crowds went wild,50
179,Tell them how I hope they shine,51
179,Long live the walls we crashed through,52
179,"I had the time of my life, with you",53
179,"Long, long live the walls we crashed through",54
179,All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you,55
179,"I was screaming, long live all the magic we made",56
179,And bring on all the pretenders,57
179,I'm not afraid,58
179,"Singing, long live all the mountains we moved",59
179,I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you,60
179,"And long, long live that look on your face",61
179,And bring on all the pretenders,62
179,"One day, we will be remembered",63
180,Elevator buttons and morning air,1
180,Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs,2
180,"If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares",3
180,"But right now, my time is theirs",4
180,Seems like there's always someone who disapproves,5
180,They'll judge it like they know about me and you,6
180,And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do,7
180,"The jury's out, but my choice is you",8
180,So don't you worry your pretty little mind,9
180,People throw rocks at things that shine,10
180,And life makes love look hard,11
180,"The stakes are high, the water's rough",12
180,But this love is ours,13
180,You never know what people have up their sleeves,14
180,Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me,15
180,Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles,16
180,"But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine",17
180,And you'll say,18
180,Don't you worry your pretty little mind,19
180,People throw rocks at things that shine,20
180,And life makes love look hard,21
180,"The stakes are high, the water's rough",22
180,But this love is ours,23
180,And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong,24
180,"And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong",25
180,And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith,26
180,With this song for you,27
180,'Cause I love the gap between your teeth,28
180,And I love the riddles that you speak,29
180,And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos,30
180,Will be ignored,31
180,'Cause my heart is yours,32
180,So don't you worry your pretty little mind,33
180,People throw rocks at things that shine,34
180,And life makes love look hard,35
180,Don't you worry your pretty little mind,36
180,People throw rocks at things that shine,37
180,But they can't take what's ours,38
180,They can't take what's ours,39
180,"The stakes are high, the water's rough",40
180,But this love is ours,41
181,"Last night, I heard my own heart beating",1
181,Sounded like footsteps on my stairs,2
181,Six months gone and I'm still reaching,3
181,Even though I know you're not there,4
181,"I was playing back a thousand memories, baby",5
181,Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through,6
181,Maybe I've been going back too much lately,7
181,When time stood still and I had you,8
181,"Come back, come back, come back to me like",9
181,"You would, you would if this was a movie",10
181,Stand in the rain outside till I came out,11
181,"Come back, come back, come back to me like",12
181,"You could, you could if you just said you're sorry",13
181,I know that we could work it out somehow,14
181,But if this was a movie you'd be here by now,15
181,I know people change and these things happen,16
181,But I remember how it was back then,17
181,Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing,18
181,'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,19
181,"Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street",20
181,Flashback to the night when you said to me,21
181,"""Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you""",22
181,Not before I knew how much I had to lose,23
181,"Come back, come back, come back to me like",24
181,"You would, you would if this was a movie",25
181,Stand in the rain outside till I came out,26
181,"Come back, come back, come back to me like",27
181,"You could, you could if you just said you're sorry",28
181,I know that we could work it out somehow,29
181,But if this was a movie you'd be here by now,30
181,"If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on",31
181,I've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone,32
181,I just want it back the way it was before,33
181,And I just want to see you back at my front door,34
181,"And I say, ""Come back, come back, come back to me like",35
181,You would before you said it's not that easy,36
181,"Before the fight, before I locked you out""",37
181,But I take it all back now,38
181,"Come back, come back, come back to me like",39
181,"You would, you would if this was a movie",40
181,Stand in the rain outside till I came out,41
181,"Come back, come back, come back to me like",42
181,"You could, you could if you just said you're sorry",43
181,I know that we could work it out somehow,44
181,But if this was a movie you'd be here by now,45
181,You'd be here by now,46
181,It's not the kind of ending you want to see now,47
181,"Baby, what about the ending?",48
181,"Oh, I thought you'd be here by now",49
181,Thought you'd be here by now,50
182,"Tall, dark, and superman",1
182,He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away,2
182,To save the world or go to work,3
182,It's the same thing to me,4
182,"He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition",5
182,I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him,6
182,"I hang on every word you say, yay",7
182,"And you smile and say, ""How are you?”",8
182,"I say, ""Just fine""",9
182,"I always forget to tell you, I love you",10
182,I love you forever,11
182,I watch superman fly away,12
182,You've got a busy day today,13
182,"Go save the world, I'll be around",14
182,I watch superman fly away,15
182,"Come back, I'll be with you someday",16
182,I'll be right here on the ground,17
182,When you come back down,18
182,"Tall, dark and beautiful",19
182,"He's complicated, he's irrational",20
182,"But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah",21
182,Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin',22
182,He's not all bad like his reputation,23
182,And I can't hear one single word they say,24
182,"And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be okay",25
182,I always forget to tell you I love you,26
182,I loved you from the very first day,27
182,I watch superman fly away,28
182,You've got a busy day today,29
182,"Go save the world, I'll be around",30
182,I watch superman fly away,31
182,"Come back, I'll be with you someday",32
182,I'll be right here on the ground,33
182,When you come back down,34
182,And I watch you fly around the world,35
182,And I hope you don't save some other girl,36
182,"Don't forget, don't forget about me",37
182,"I'm far away, but I never let you go",38
182,I'm love-struck and looking out the window,39
182,"Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be",40
182,"Right here, wishing the flowers were from you",41
182,Wishing the card was from you,42
182,Wishing the call was from you,43
182,'Cause I loved you from the very first day,44
182,I watch superman fly away,45
182,You've got a busy day today,46
182,"Go save the world, I'll be around",47
182,Forever and ever here,48
182,I watch superman fly away,49
182,"I swear, I'll be with you someday",50
182,I'll be right here on the ground,51
182,When you come back down,52
182,"La, la, la, la, la, la",53
182,"La, la, la, la, la, la",54
182,When you come back down,55
